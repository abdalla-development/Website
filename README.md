Creating a website had become much easy these days by the use of Bootstrap, it makes a considerable simplification to the implementation process, but the hardest part was to customize those features to your design.  The second hard part was the implementation process of   Color Theory, Typography, User interface design, and user experience design to reflect a strong message to the user, it will take an enumerate effort and will require more practice and experience.
For future improvement, the need for more working of the design pillars is a must, in order to reduce time and increasing efficiency.
